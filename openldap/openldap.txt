# note
There are two special pseudo attributes entry and children.
To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have read access to the target's entry attribute.
To perform a search, the subject must have search access to the search base's entry attribute.
To add or delete an entry, the subject must have write access to the entry's entry attribute AND must have write access to the entry's parent's children attribute.
To rename an entry, the subject must have write access to entry's entry attribute AND have write access to both the old parent's and new parent's children attributes.
The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.
